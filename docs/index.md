# Welcome to Docktuna

**Docktuna** is a project template that enables [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna), a hyperparameter tuning framework, to run with a PostgreSQL backend â€” all within a fully containerized Docker environment. Itâ€™s designed to be a starting point for your own model tuning workflows, with GPU support, Conda + Poetry environments, secrets management, and automated testing.

> ðŸ“š **Note:** Most of the project documentation currently lives in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/duanegoodner/docktuna). This site focuses on API reference material, with room to expand in the future.
